## Dining Hall Live Report

### App Description
This app will allow you to report to other students live on campus how the food at a certain dining hall was. It is a quick and efficient way to see if it is worth making the walk to a certain dining hall, or if you should make your way somewhere else

### App Idea Evaluation
- Category: Productivity
- Mobile: This would be avaliable on both mobile and web. Students would log in with their university log in and from there have access to the dining halls and what they are serving
- Story: Allows for quick and efficient exchange of crucial information
- Market: Mainly for university students looking to maximize their time and energy
- Habit: It wouldn't be utilized as often as other apps - at most maybe three times a day
- Scope: The first launch would probably just include comments from students. A second update would involve photos and comments, and a third update could potentially include a way to contact dining hall officials and speak with them directly
